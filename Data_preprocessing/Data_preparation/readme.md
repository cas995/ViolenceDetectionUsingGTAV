This project collected a GTA-V Fight dataset for people fight pose estimation by exploiting the realistic video game GTA- V. The videos were collected from YouTube videos and self-created videos from the video game. The input layer of the 3D CNN network expects sequence of frames as inputs. The GTA-V Fight dataset consists of videos and must therefore be converted into sequences of frames. The results of the GTA-V fight dataset were assessed by comparing them with three well-studied datasets for violence recognition. These datasets are called evaluation datasets.

The file ViolenceDetectionUsingGTAV/Data_preprocessing/Data_preparation/Preprocessing-GTA-V_dataset.ipynb contains the pre-processing steps for the GTA-V dataset.

The file ViolenceDetectionUsingGTAV/Data_preprocessing/Data_preparation/Preprocessing-Evaluation_datasets.ipynb contains the pre-processing steps for the evaluation datasets.
